# Matlab OpenSim scripts

MATLAB sripts to manipulate OpenSim models, for example for plotting moment arms against joint angles, editing model parameters etc. Also some scripts demonstrating basic modelling principles or useful modelling utilities.

Future Goals:
Create MATLAB file with matrix of all moment arms for all configurations of joint angle
